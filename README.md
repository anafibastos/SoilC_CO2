# SoilC_CO2
## Overview
Here, we collect data on the effects of elevated CO2 on soil carbon stocks (βsoil) in both relative and absolute terms and synthesize them through meta-analysis. We also collect data on climatic, experimental, and vegetation characteristics that could potentially explain variability in βsoil (“predictors”). In Fig. 1, we show a classic descriptive meta-analysis of overall βsoil across different predictor factors. We next combine the strengths of meta-analysis and random-forest –MetaForest– to quantify the relative importance of 19 predictors in explaining βsoil in the dataset. 
In Fig. 2, we describe the regression between βsoil and its most important predictor (βplant), and explore the reasons explaining the sign and nature of this relationship. In Fig. 3, we apply the data-trained MetaForest model in absolute terms to upscale βsoil globally. Finally, we investigate whether the emerging relationship between βsoil and βplant found in experiments in represented in models (Fig. 4).
